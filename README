The codes here are the templates that can analysis the events with XGB. 
the XGB can be replace with other deep learning algorithm, which will be studied later.

1) Get_WW.C  --> trans the root file to csv file as the XGB input.

2) WWZZ.py   --> The main function to classify the events with XGB.

3) Save.py   --> The function can save the results of classify to csv file.

4) call_function.cpp  --> The template can run python with C++. 
   (This is vary important in the later work, which can be added in event analysis procedure!)

5) UScsvToRoot.C  --> The template that trans the classify results(csv format) to root.
